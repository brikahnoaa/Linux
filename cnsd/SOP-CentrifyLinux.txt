SOP ­ Centrify Installation on RHEL

INSTALLATION

 Make sure DNS is set to the Active Directory domain controllers (ie PRUE or    PESTO)
 Obtain the appropriate installer file from eclipse:/home/eclipse/cnsd/centrify As of 9/16/14, the PMEL approved version is  v5.2
 Decompress the file
 run the install.sh file
 Use the following responses for the installer  questions
 For Centrify package ­ How do you want to  proceed
S (for Centrify Standard)
 Do you want to run adcheck to verify your AD   environment
Y
 Please enter the Active Directory domain to check   [company.com]:
pmel.noaa.gov
 Join an Active Directory  domain
Y
 Enter the Active Directory domain to  join:
pmel.noaa.gov
 Enter the Active Directory authorized  user:
administrator
 Enter the password for the Active Directory  user:
<AD administrator pw>
 Enter the computer name:
<use the fqdn>
 Enter the container DN:
Computers (will change later in  AD)
 Enter the name of the zone:
Seattle Linux (or Newport  Linux)
 Enter the name of the domain  controller:
<auto detect>
 Reboot the computer after  installation
Y (if feasible)
 Verify the Centrify packages to install. They should be CentrifyDC and CentrifyDC­openssh
 Do you want to continue
         Y (or make the appropriate changes) This should complete the  installation

POST INSTALL

 Enable AD user login functionality in Active Directory ­ PERFORMED on system with Centrify DirectManage Access Manager  installed:
 Verify the AD user has been defined in DirectManage under Global/Unix Data/Users.
 Drill down to the appropriate child zone (Seattle Linux or Newport Linux) and select Computers.   Expand the target system and highlight Role  Assignments.
 If the target user is not defined with a login role, right­click and select Assign Role…  This will bring up the Select Role  applet:
 Highlight the login role for the target zone and select  OK.
 The Assign Role applet is then brought up. Add the appropriate AD account and select OK, then OK to complete adding the  role.
 If unique user information is needed for the system, the user needs to be added to the Unix data for that system and  modified:
 Expand UNIX Data for the system and highlight  Users.
 Right­click and Add User to  Zone
 Select the user from the applet and a Set UNIX User Profile applet will come up. Set the attributes accordingly. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO SET THE CORRECT HOME DIRECTORY  HERE.
 Back on the target system, perform the following to reload the   cache:
sudo adreload sudo adflush
You may need to reboot and reload the cache again if the system does not take the users credentials right  away.
 Move Computer Account to Appropriate AD  Container:
 In order for Group Policy to propagate to the system, the computer account needs to be in the correct OU container in  AD.
 On any AD server, open Active Directory Users and   Computers
 If the system was installed with default values as above, the system is in the default Computers OU
 Move the computer account to the appropriate OU   container:
PMEL Systems ­> Core ­> Seattle ­> Linux ­> CAC <choose> PMEL Systems ­> Core ­> Newport ­> Linux ­> CAC   <choose>
 Configuring Existing and Future Local and Service   Accounts:
 Add any service accounts to /etc/centrifydc/user.ignore (namely the cnsd account)
 SSH Configuration:
 IF THE CENTRIFY SSHD WAS INSTALLED ­  edit
/etc/centrifydc/ssh/sshd_config:
 PermitRootLogin ­ Uncomment and set to  no
 Banner ­ set to previous banner at   /etc/ssh/sshd_banner
 Existing Local Account  Configuration:

 FOR EXISTING USERS ­ modify /etc/centrifydc/centrifydc.conf file to map existing users to domain accounts. Look for and append to the mapuser section.  Use the following  format:
pam.mapuser.<username>: <username@pmel.noaa.gov
The @pmel.noaa.gov refers to the kerberos realm.
	IF LOCAL ACCOUNT LOGON FUNCTIONALITY IS NEEDED, the control can be modified to allow for local user account access overriding AD authentication. THis can be handy when AD is down or Centrify is disconnected and no caching is available:
¦	Modify  /etc/centrifydc/centrifydc.conf file and search for the
pam.allow.override line
¦	Add any needed local accounts next to root separated by a space
¦	Perform a cache reload via adreload and adflush
¦	Now login as <username>@localhost (the @localhost is very important) and type the local password
	Add Smart Card Support:r
	Open terminal, su to root
	Remove openct, pcsc-lite-openct -  
   rpm -e openct pcsc-lite-openct
	Install smart card support -  
   yum groupinstall "Smart card support"
	Install subordinate packages -  
   yum install krb5-workstation krb5-auth-dialog krb5-pkinit-openssl
	Enable smartcard authentication with Centrify sctool -  
*** <blk update, checked pkgs.
  yum install krb5-workstation 
  yum groupinstall "Smart card support"
   sctool -e
	You may need to manually enable Smart Card authentication by using the system-config-authentication applet on RHEL.
	Group Policy:
	In order to refresh AD Group Policy on RHEL, perform as root (or sudo):
 adgpupdate 
Verify the target system is in the correct OU container in AD:
PMEL Systems -> Core -> Seattle -> Linux -> CAC <choose>  PMEL Systems -> Core -> Newport -> Linux -> CAC <choose> 
	adinGroup Policy objects are edited on any AD controller using the Group Policy Management application
	Verification of any group policy object and/or control can be found by viewing the following files on the target system:
 /var/centrifydc/reg/machine/gp.report 
 /var/centrifydc/reg/user/<username>/gp.report 
	KERBEROS Ticket Persistence (OPTIONAL):
	Kerberos tickets can be configured for persistence when SSH is used and authentication is needed when drilling SSH sessions to multiple systems.  IF THIS FUNCTIONALITY IS NEEDED:
¦	Open Active Directory Users and Computers
¦	Drill down and find the target system computer account
¦	Right-click and select Properties
¦	Select the Delegation tab
¦	Select Trust this computer for delegation to any service (Kerberos only) and hit apply
¦	The system will need a cache reflush and gpupdate for the change to take effect.  Or simply wait at least 90 minutes before a system AD refresh
	Setting up PREVALIDATION (OPTIONAL):
	User credentials can be “pre-cached” so that a Centrify system that can be set up and joined and will have immediate offline login access
	Any user who is going to be prevalidated will first need to be registered in Active Directory:
¦	On a Windows AD server, open a command prompt and run:
setspn -A preval/<username> <username>
To view who in AD has already been configured for prevalidation: setspn -Q preval/*
	On the target system:
¦	Edit /etc/centrifydc/centrifydc.conf file
¦	Search for the adclient.prevalidate.allow.users section and create a new line below and enter:
adclient.prevalidate.allow.users: <username>
or
adclient.prevalidate.allow.groups: <groupname>
Separate multiple entries with a comma.
¦	Save and reload the cache:
sudo adreload 
    sudo adflush 
When using prevalidation by group, make sure that the AD group is recognised by the Centrify agent. To check which groupnames can be seen for a specific user, run the following command from the Centrify system: 
 adquery user --groups <username>
